<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; font-size: 1.1em;">
Iâ€™m a Data Scientist and Data Engineer with an academic background in computational science, with a strong focus on artificial intelligence. I use AI and data science to build scalable, accessible, and sustainable solutions, tackling complex challenges. By combining both applied experience and academic knowledge, I design and implement data pipelines and systems that are adaptable, built to last, and optimized for real-world impact.
